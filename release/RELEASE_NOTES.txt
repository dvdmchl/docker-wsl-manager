# Docker WSL Manager - Release 1.1.0

## What's New in 1.1.0

### Features & Enhancements
- **Enhanced Log Viewer**: Refactored to support real-time log streaming with ANSI color support.
- **Smart Scroll Lock**: Implemented a robust scroll-lock mechanism that pauses auto-scrolling while reading history and resumes at the bottom.
- **Container Details Page**: Renamed "View Logs" to "Open Details", providing a dedicated space to view output and control the container.
- **Reactive UI**: Action buttons (Start, Stop, Restart) now automatically react to the container's running state.
- **Dynamic Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implemented configurable shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+S, Ctrl+R) for all major actions via a new Settings menu.
- **Auto-Update Check**: The application now automatically checks for newer versions on GitHub during startup.
- **Configurable Auto-Refresh**: Added an option to toggle and customize the container list refresh interval.
- **Clickable Ports**: Container ports in the Details view are now clickable hyperlinks.
- **Better Keyboard Control**: The application now focuses the first container on startup for immediate keyboard navigation.

### Fixes & Quality
- **Improved Stability**: Resolved multiple potential memory leaks and null pointer issues (verified via SonarQube & SpotBugs).
- **Stream Reliability**: Fixed an issue where logs would stop updating after a container restart.
- **Code Quality**: Achieved a passing status on the local SonarQube Quality Gate.
